### Simulation File

The original LTspice simulation file used for this project is available here:

- [`ecg_circuit.asc`](simulations/ecg_circuit.asc)

This file includes:
- ECG input from a file-based voltage source
- Instrumentation amplifier, notch filter, and low-pass filter blocks
- Setup for both transient and AC analysis
